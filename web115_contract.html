      <h2>Contract</h2>
      <p>
        I,
        <a href="intro.html">Shishant Bohora</a>
        , agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2025 WEB115 course with my
        instructor, D.I. von Briesen
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites
        will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information
        there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep
        private.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not
        logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments
        may show as absences.
      </p>
      <p>Signed: <em>Shishant Bohora, 19 Janurary 2025</em></p>
